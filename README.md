Assessment
The React assignment should take you less than 2 hours to complete. If you go over, please stop.

Send a link to paulzakin@bsd.uchicago.edu with a link to the repo with your solution once complete.

Overview
Build a React + TypeScript application utilizing the GitHub API to show data related to a given user.

Requirements
Use Create React App or Next.js to avoid wasting time on configuration.

The app only has one page /. Hence, no routing required.

The app fetches the results from this API call (https://api.github.com/users/[your-github-username]) with any GitHub username.

Example: https://api.github.com/users/paulzakin

The user enters the username in a search bar to fetch the result.

After the result has been fetched, present the following on the page:

Name
Bio
Username
Email
Avatar (Through Avatar URL).
The app should look reasonably nice and be mobile responsive. Don't use a CSS framework.
